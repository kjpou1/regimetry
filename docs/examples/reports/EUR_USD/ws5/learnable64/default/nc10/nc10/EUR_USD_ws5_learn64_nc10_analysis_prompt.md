ðŸ“Š Cluster Report Analysis Prompt  
You are an expert in time-series regime detection using transformer embeddings, spectral clustering, and price overlays. Analyze the clustering report for the instrument below.

**Instrument**: EUR_USD  
**Experiment ID**: EUR_USD_ws5_learn64_nc10  
**Config File**: config/default.yaml  
**Window Size**: 5  
**Embedding Dim**: 64  
**Encoding Method**: Learnable  
*Note: Encoding style is only applicable to sinusoidal encodings.*
**Number of Clusters**: 10  

You are provided with:
- A t-SNE plot with cluster ID overlay  
- A UMAP plot with cluster ID overlay  
- A price overlay with time-aligned cluster segments (full length)  
- A **zoomed price overlay showing the last 150 bars**  
- A cluster distribution histogram  

#### Your tasks:
1. **Regime Separation**: Are the clusters well-separated in t-SNE and UMAP? Are there overlaps or tight transitions?
2. **Temporal Alignment**: Do the cluster transitions correspond to meaningful price trend changes in the price overlay?
3. **Final Regime**: *Using the zoomed 150-bar chart*, determine which cluster governs the final price regime. Is it stable or volatile? Large or small?
4. **Cluster Sizes**: Are any clusters over/under-represented in the distribution?
5. **Dimensional Suitability**: Does the embedding dimension (64) appear sufficient compared to a higher-dim baseline?
6. **Improvement Areas**: Suggest if the current number of clusters (`nc=10`) is adequate or whether a higher/lower `n_clusters` may capture better structure.
7. **Final Verdict**: Would you approve this config for production regime labeling?

> ðŸ“Œ For recent regime analysis (Tasks 2â€“3), focus on the **zoomed last 150 bars** plot for higher accuracy. Use the full-length overlay only for global context.

Please return a concise but structured summary with bullets and decision recommendations.
